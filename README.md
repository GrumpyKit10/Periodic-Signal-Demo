# Periodic-Signal-Demo

This MATLAB project demonstrates the creation of a periodic signal from a piecewise linear waveform. The script generates an original time-domain signal with two linear cycles, then constructs a discrete periodic version of the signal using sampled points. Both the original continuous signal and the periodic discrete signal are plotted together to illustrate periodicity and sampling.

## Features
- Generates a piecewise linear signal
- Creates a discrete periodic version of the signal
- Visualizes both continuous and discrete signals in the same plot

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018b or newer

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Periodic-Signal-Demo.git
